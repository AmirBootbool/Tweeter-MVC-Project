// An array of posts - this should be private. Use the dummy data below to get started
// A variable postIdCounter to count the number of total posts
// A variable commentIdCounter to count the number of total comments
// A getPosts function that returns the posts array
// An addPost function that receives some text and adds a post object to posts
// Each object should have three properties: id, text, and comments
// You should generate the next id correctly for each post: "p4", "p5", ...
// The comments array should be empty initially
// A removePost function that receives a postID and removes the relevant post from posts
